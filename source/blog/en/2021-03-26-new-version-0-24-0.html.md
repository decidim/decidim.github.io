## Release highlights

### Admin

This version adds important improvements related to moderation. Decidim instances have more and more activity, and with activity comes SPAM, bots and other internet phenomena üëæ.

We have added a global moderation panel to make it easier for admins, and the possibility to block users.

Also notifications about reported content have been improved, and some other things you will find in this list:

### Consultations

During the last year we have been working on a new secure voting module with cryptographic guarantees. This new participation space will be available soon, and will replace the Consultations space. This doesn't mean that Consultations will disappear, it will continue to exist as a module maintained by the community. More information on this topic in future releases.
