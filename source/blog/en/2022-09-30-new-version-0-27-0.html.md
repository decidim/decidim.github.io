## Release highlights

This version comes with important news, as we are tackling the development of a [PWA for Decidim](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/discussions/8334) and we are moving forward with the complete redesign of the interface. In fact, we foresee that this will be the last version with the current design. If you plan to make code contributions in the near future, please take a look at this announcement: [https://github.com/decidim/decidim/discussions/95](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/discussions/9512)

Some highlights are:

### Push notifications

Since we’re in the process of improving the mobile experience, this release adds a power feature: push notifications! Configure your notifications to get them in real time, or choose whether you prefer to receive a daily or weekly e-mail digest

### Installer (1st iteration)

We've modified the default installation to configure most of the application through Environment Variables. For existing installations, we recommend that you migrate to this new model, so it's easier to configure your applications.

As an example, after migrating to this, if you want to enable a setting, you'll need to:

1. Set the correct Environment Variable
2. Restart the server

Until now, the flow could be something like:

1. Change your initializer
2. Commit to git 
3. Push to git server
4. Deploy to the Rails server
5. Restart the server

For migrating:

* Backup your config/secrets.yml and config/initializers/decidim.rb
* Generate a new decidim app and copy your generated files
* Migrate your old settings to the new Environment Variables.

Learn more about [Environment Variables at Decidim Documentation](https://docs.decidim.org/en/configure/environment_variables/). 

* Make Decidim fully configurable via ENV vars [\#8725](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/8725)
* Make Decidim fully configurable via ENV vars part II [\#8990](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/8990)
* Configure online meetings embedded services with ENV vars [\#9219](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/9219)

### Cookies

Yep, we were a bit late, but we finally got there. Same old cookies, but properly informed.
