*Hal Seki. Founder of Code for Japan*

The first Decidim instance in the Pacific island was deployed on the year 2020 at [Kakogawa](https://kakogawa.diycities.jp), later came [Yosano](https://yosano.makeour.city), [Nishiaizu](https://nishiaizu.makeour.city), [Kamaishi](https://kamaishi.makeour.city) and the community instance [Meta](https://meta.diycities.jp). 

## Why did you choose Decidim?

First, Decidim was open-source software and Code for Japan is a community that promotes public-private partnerships through open data and open-source software.

Second, Decidim was very actively updated among other tools that checked. Third, Decidim provides customize-friendly architecture so that we can adapt it to our domestic situation.

## What were you looking for when deploying a Decidim

* **Robustness**: Our clients are primarily governments. Robustness is essential for them.
* **i18n support**: It's important to be used in Japanese.
* **User interface**: It should be easy to use for non-technical people.
* **Accessibility**: We should cover various types of people.

## What did you learn from this experience?

Open-Government in Japan is halfway down the road. But, we feel the potential of our fellow in each region, especially future generations, for developing digital competencies: In a depopulated town, a group of junior high school students uses Decidim to make a proposal for community development. Adults in and outside the town make efforts to implement their proposals. Those experiences will create a new base of citizenship for the young generation.
