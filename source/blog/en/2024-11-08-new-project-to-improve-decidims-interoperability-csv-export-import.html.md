title: "New project to improve Decidim's interoperability: CSV Export/Import"
---
Decidim's project *"Interoperable CSV Exports/Imports for Participatory Objects on the Decidim Platform"* has been selected and will receive funding to undertake a new initiative aimed at improving the platform's interoperability, supported by [Metagov](https://metagov.github.io/interop/).

### What is the Project About?

The main goal of this project is to enhance Decidim's interoperability by redesigning CSV export and import functionalities for participatory objects. While Decidim already allows CSV exports of database objects and the import of some of them, this project will make these features more accessible and focused on interoperability.

Currently, many of Decidim's CSV export tools are only available through the admin panel, limiting public access to data. With this project, we plan to make these functionalities publicly available, facilitating Decidim's integration with external systems and promoting data transparency.

### What Will Change?

* **Redesign of CSV Files:** The existing flatfile formats will be redesigned to ensure their interoperability with other systems, improving data exchange between Decidim and third-party platforms.
* **Enhanced Import Features:** CSV import tools will be adapted to comply with the Interoperable Deliberative Tools standard, allowing for more efficient data integration and migration.

### Why Is This Important?

Interoperability is essential for enabling collaboration between platforms and fostering innovation in participatory and democratic technologies. By enhancing our CSV capabilities, we aim to streamline the flow of data in and out of Decidim, strengthening transparency and equipping developers, participation specialists, and our community with more effective tools.

We thank Metagov for their support and collaboration in this project, which will help expand Decidim's capabilities and move towards a more inclusive and connected tech ecosystem.

Last week, our colleague Andr√©s was in San Francisco, participating in the cohort meeting for this grant. It was a great experience where we were able to learn about many interesting projects and establish connections with them.
