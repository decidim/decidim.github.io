### Meetings

Highlights of this release besides the code refactors are the new features to improve and enhance online meetings.

One of the most interesting is the possibility to include polls in the meetings, in order to receive feedback from the participants or to make decisions in real time.

Thus, the admin can configure the questions, activate them, get answers and publish the results in a synchronous way.
