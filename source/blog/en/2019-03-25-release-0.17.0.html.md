### **Initiatives**

A new iteration of Initiatives has been made. Until now this participation space was made to comply with the rules of participation of Barcelona City Council and with the new improvements can be used and adapted by any other organization:

* The process to manage the initiatives has been enhanced by improving the experience on their administration.

* The process to sign an initiative has been enhanced by adding new steps in the signature process in order to improve the system and providing more security.

* Finally, in order to improve the participant experience on initiatives, we have made several changes to apply in different pages of initiatives
