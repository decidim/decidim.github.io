        Thanks to Decidim, in Barcelona we have managed to co-produce a strategic
        city plan together with the citizens. In 2016 we inaugurated the Municipal
        Action Plan in the form of a participatory process through Decidim
        Barcelona. Currently, this plan includes almost 7 thousand citizen
        proposals. One of the advantages of using this platform is that you can
        monitor at all times the state of implementation of the approved
        proposals.

        With the implementation of Decidim in Som Energia we have generated a
        kinder space for participation. We released the tool in 2018, hosting the
        General Assembly of the Cooperative and months later we debated the Image
        Redesign and collaborative development of the School of Som Energia, among
        other participatory processes. In a few months, more than 3,500
        participant people have registered, 5 participatory processes, 3
        assemblies operating and more than 1,300 votes in the last General
        Assembly vote.

        interactions including proposals, comments, suggestions and support that

        Almost every participatory process that has come to our table, we have been able

        However, the part that seems strongest and most important to us is its community,
        both developers and those who use it for participatory processes. Coexisting with
        them has made us appreciate the challenges involved in implementing participatory
        democracy in the real world.

        <h3>a. Data collected from surfing the Website</h3> <p>When using our website, <a
        href="%{decidim_url}">Decidim</a> uses the services of Plausible analysis software.  Its is software that, when
        tracking user data, this data is kept fully and securely encrypted. The purpose of Plausible Analytics is to
        track general traffic trends on your website and not individual visitors. Each HTTP request sends the IP address
        and user agent to the server, so that's what they use, generating an identifier that changes daily using the
        visitor's IP address and user agent. To anonymise this data, it is passed through a hash function with a
        rotating salt. This generates a random string of letters and numbers that is used to calculate the number of
        unique visitors for the day. The IP address of the raw data and the user agent are never stored in the logs,
        databases or anywhere on Plausible analytics disk. Older salts are deleted every 24 hours to avoid the
        possibility of linking visitor information from one day to the next.   In this way, no personal user data is
        collected while browsing our website, for more information about the data processing by Plausible Analytics, you
        can visit their website at <a

        lawfully processing it.</li> <li><b>Request correction</b> of the personal data that we hold about you. This
        enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify
        the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</li> <li><b>Request erasure</b> of your personal data. This
        enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to
        process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully
        exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information
        unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we
        may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified
        to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</li> <li><b>Object to processing</b> of your personal data
        where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your
        particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your
        fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data
        for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to
        process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</li> <li><b>Request restriction of
        processing</b> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data
        in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data
        is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer
        require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of
        your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li> <li><b>Request the
        transfer</b> of your personal data to you or to a third party (right to data portability). We will provide to
        you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable
        format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us
        to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</li> <li><b>Withdraw consent at any
        time</b> where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the
        lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may
        not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time
        you withdraw your consent.</li> </ul> <p>The aforementioned rights may be effective by contacting us at <a

        the competent authority, in this case the Spanish Data Protection Agency (Agencia Española de Protección de
